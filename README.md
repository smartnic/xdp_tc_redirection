# xdp_tc_redirection
Packet redirection using tc/XDP

#Refer to tc_instructions.txt and xdp_instructions.txt for info on how to run the programs.

If you want to directly test stuff without any of the details; make xdp_dispatch.sh and tc_test.sh executable and run them with root access (i.e. sudo ./tc_test.sh)
